VITA:
Issues with installing pytorch version, had to get website install line but couldn't install their wanted version of cuda had to use 12.1
Didn't use default system variable path for CUDA had to make a new one named "CUDA_HOME" instead of default "CUDA PATH"

 C:\Users\Zach\VITA\mask2former\modeling\pixel_decoder\ops>sh make.sh
make.sh: line 9: $'\r': command not found
make.sh: line 12: $'\r': command not found
'nvalid command name 'install

Installed dos2linux to fix this error

tried to run evaluation
python train_net_vita.py \
  --config-file configs/youtubevis_2019/vita_R50_bs8.yaml \
  --eval-only MODEL.WEIGHTS vita_r50_coco.pth

Got an error saying MODEL.WEIGHTS is an unknown command

Since CUDA was detected with the new path name, I decided to go back to R2VOS to see if it would work with this new path name and it did, kept going forward with R2VOS




OnlineRefer:
Same errors as R2vos because they both redlied on referFormer
note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
  ERROR: Failed building wheel for pycocotools

'Cuda is not availabel' Error

Once I got Cuda detected I kept going forward with R2VOS instead of OnlineRefer

had to install from alternate source

'Cuda is not availabel' Error
I had cuda and cuda toolkit installed. added pytorch-cuda=11.8 to pytorch install command still got this error. When working with VITA it told me to change the CUDA path name to CUDA_HOME instead of the default path name of CUDA_PATH and I decided to go back to R2VOS to see if this is why CUDA wasn't being detected and it was.
